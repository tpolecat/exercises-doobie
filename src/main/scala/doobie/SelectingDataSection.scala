/**
  * We are gonna construct some programs that retrieve data from the database and stream it back,
  * mapping to Scala types on the way.
  *
  * We will be playing with the country table that has the following structure:
  * {{{
  * CREATE TABLE country (
  * code       character(3)  NOT NULL,
  * name       text          NOT NULL,
  * population integer       NOT NULL,
  * gnp        numeric(10,2)
  * )
  * }}}
  *
  * For the exercises, the ''country'' table will contain:
  * {{{
  * code    name                      population    gnp
  * "DEU"  "Germany"                    82164700    2133367.00
  * "ESP"  "Spain"                      39441700          null
  * "FRA"  "France",                    59225700    1424285.00
  * "GBR"  "United Kingdom"             59623400    1378330.00
  * "USA"  "United States of America"  278357000    8510700.00
  * }}}
  *
  * == How to select data ==
  *
  * As we commented in the previous section, the `sql` string interpolator allow us to create a
  * query to select data from the database.
  *
  * For instance, `sql"select name from country".query[String]` defines a `Query0[String]`, which
  * is a one-column query that maps each returned row to a String.
  *
  * Once we generate this query, we could use several convenience methods to stream the results:
  *  - `.list`, which accumulates the results to a `List`, in this case yielding a
  * `ConnectionIO[List[String]]`.
  *  - `.vector`, which accumulates to a `Vector`
  *  - `.to[Coll]`, which accumulates to a type `Coll`, given an implicit `CanBuildFrom`. This works
  * with Scala standard library collections.
  *  - `.accumulate[M[_]: MonadPlus]` which accumulates to a universally quantified monoid `M`.
  * This works with many scalaz collections, as well as standard library collections with
  * `MonadPlus` instances.
  *  - `.unique` which returns a single value, raising an exception if there is not exactly
  * one row returned.
  *  - `.option` which returns an Option, raising an exception if there is more than
  * one row returned.
  *  - `.nel` which returns an `NonEmptyList`, raising an exception if there are no rows returned.
  *  - See the Scaladoc for [[http://tpolecat.github.io/doc/doobie/0.3.0/api/index.html#doobie.util.query$$Query0 `Query0`]]
  * for more information on these and other methods.
  *
  * == Note ==
  *
  * To run the exercises, we need to create a table in memory and populate it before each exercise
  * and clean up the data once the exercise has been run.
  *
  * To do that, we have defined a method called `inDb` that:
  *  - receives a doobie code block that performs a query to the database
  *  - executes the data initialization (before running the provided code block) and performs a
  * cleanup task at the end of the execution
  *  - returns a ConnectionIO that contains the result of the query
  *
  * {{{
  * def inDb[A](thunk: => ConnectionIO[A]) = for {
  *   _ <- initializeData
  *   result <- thunk
  *   _ <- cleanupData
  * } yield result
  * }}}
  *
  * So, whenever you find an `inDb` wrapper, it's just performing the tasks described above.
